# Enligne Library Backend - Express.js

This is the backend server for the Enligne Library project. It provides an API for uploading, downloading, managing books, and author information. The server is built using Express.js, a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.

**Note: This project primarily focuses on the backend implementation, and the frontend is not important for the current scope of this project. Therefore, no frontend-related details, such as UI design or frontend setup, are provided in this README file.**
